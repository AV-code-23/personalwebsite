  <!--About Me-->

      <h1 class="abouth">About Me</h1>
      <p class="aboutd">Hi there! I'm Adriana, and I'm excited to share a bit about myself with you.<br>
      I'm currently a junior in high school, and I've always been fascinated by technology and its potential to transform our lives. I'm also passionate about entrepreneurship, and in the future I hope to merge both passions into a unique and meaningful career.<br>
        When I'm not coding, you can find me dancing, reading fiction, and playing videogames! One of my favorite quotes is "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take" by Wayne Gretzky, as it inspires me to think of what could be, instead of what could've been.<br><br>
        I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow my skills in tech, and I'm excited to see where this passion will take me next.
      </p>


  


  <!--Learning Journey-->
  <h1 class="ljheader">Learning Journey</h1>
  <p class="ljcontent">Despite my interest in technology from a young age, I didn't really dive into coding. Last year, I decided to start learning coding after realizing that I wanted to pursue a career in software engineering and build cool stuff! Over the past year, I've made some progress. Some of the key milestones in my journey include:<br><br>
    - Completed introductory courses with Girls Who Code on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and game development.<br><br>
    - Participate in Google's Code Next program, learning the basics of Python, p5.js, as well as receiving mentorship from Google engineers.<br><br>
    - Now participating as a fellow in Headstarter AI.
